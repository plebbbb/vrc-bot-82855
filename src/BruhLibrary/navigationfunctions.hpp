/*motionpath:
    The goal of this is to implement movement paths through multiple points without
    stopping

    The current method of using a global trajectory array is kinda sketchy to use
    if we are gonna end up using this approach, but it's probably doable.
    The trajectory array is going to become an imaginary target though.

    The code design for this will have 3 development stages
      1. Converting PID speeds into percentage points for S curves, and making
        the bot not stop after each curve by making the PID percentage be over
        the entire trajectory
          This will be done by either:
            - Making Tcoords into a bait coordinate, and getting axiscontrollers to
            automatically convert to percentage inside coordcontroller by extending
            tcoords percent units ahead in the ideal(line) direction (only good for 1.)
            - Make low key motion profiling and then turn the axis controller from being
            the primary source of movement into something used to maintain the profiling
            speed targets
      2. Adding a speed control when turning corners to minimize shaking from inertia(we might skip this)
      3. Making a curved transision between point to basically eliminate shaking

      Current implementation: step 1 done, low key motion profiling implementation
